# üÉè Dealer's Choice Poker

## üÉè Overview

DCP is a real-time multiplayer card game application built with Next.js and WebSockets. The application features user authentication, real-time gameplay, and a responsive UI. It will eventually feature extensive stat-tracking and a custom game variant editor to allow players to deal any kind of poker game they can think of.

## Why?

There are lots of online poker games out there already, what's different about this one? 

I really enjoy playing poker, but I get freakin' tired of playing Texas Hold'Em all the time. It's all anyone seems to know or understand, at least in the casual poker player arena. I always played Dealer's Choice with my friends, where we could deal any kind of poker game we wanted when it was our turn. And I mean any kind. Anything we could come up with, crazy community boards, different layouts, different rules for how you could combine the cards on the board, and it made it WAY MORE FUN.

So, I wanted to capture that awesome unpredictability and excitement, but in an online poker format. That's why!
