# üÉè Dealer's Choice Poker

## üÉè Overview

DCP is a real-time multiplayer card game application built with Next.js and WebSockets. The application features user authentication, real-time gameplay, and a responsive UI. It will eventually feature extensive stat-tracking and a custom game variant editor to allow players to deal any kind of poker game they can think of.

## üÉè Why?

There are lots of online poker games out there already, what's different about this one? 

I really enjoy playing poker, but I get freakin' tired of playing Texas Hold'Em all the time. It's all anyone seems to know or understand, at least in the casual poker player arena. I always played Dealer's Choice with my friends, where we could deal any kind of poker game we wanted when it was our turn. And I mean any kind. Anything we could come up with, crazy community boards, different layouts, different rules for how you could combine the cards on the board, and it made it WAY MORE FUN.

So, I wanted to capture that awesome unpredictability and excitement, but in an online poker format. That's why!

## üÉè Key Architecture Points

- **Next.js App Router**: Pages and API routes organized in the `/app` directory
- **React Context**: Used for authentication
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database implementation for user profiles, statistics, etc.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication between clients and server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach

## üÉè Getting Started

To setup the project in a development environment, see the Contributing section at the bottom of this README. For developer guides and function descriptions, please see the individual documentation files in the `/docs` directory. Finally, once the project is in a state worthy of going live, the URL of the site will be posted.

## üÉè Future Development

Areas for future development and improvement include:

- Adding more game types beyond the current card game
- Implementing a persistent storage solution for game history
- Enhancing the lobby system with game filtering and searching
- Adding social features like friends lists and private games
- Comprehensive statistics-tracking and leaderboards
- Improved UI layouts
